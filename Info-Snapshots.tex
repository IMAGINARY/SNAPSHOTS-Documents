The Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO) is very well-known for the high quality of the mathematical research that is being created, discussed, and presented here. In the last years, it has also obtained a reputation for mathematics communication.

In 2013, the MFO has been awarded a major grant by the Klaus Tschira Foundation and the Oberwolfach Foundation for the project {\it Oberwolfach meets IMAGINARY}. In this project, we will create and collect high quality content for the mathematics communication platform \url{www.imaginary.org} at the MFO. In particular, we would like to ask you, the participants of the scientific programs at the MFO, to volunteer to write generally accessible texts, the so-called {\it snapshots of modern mathematics from Oberwolfach}. Snapshots selected by the organizers of the scientific programs will be professionally edited and formatted; they should be short (approx.\ 5-8 A5 sized pages) and address a topic that is related to the research topic of your program at the MFO. The targeted readership consists of mathematics teachers, science journalists, undergraduate and advanced high school students, etc. They can be written in English or German.

The snapshot project is designed to promote the understanding and appreciation of modern mathematics and mathematical research in the general public world-wide. If you are interested in writing a snapshot, please contact the organizers of your program. They can also provide you with helpful guidelines.\\

\subsubsection*{About \url{www.imaginary.org}}
The web platform \url{www.imaginary.org} was launched in February 2013 by the MFO. It is funded by the Klaus Tschira Foundation. This open source and participative platform allows anyone to upload and download material (picture galleries, software packages, explanatory texts, videos etc.) related to mathematics. It is currently available in English, German, and Spanish and will soon be available in other languages, too. The platform \url{www.imaginary.org} is used widely by teachers who want to enhance their mathematics courses, by museums, mathematics departments and research institutes who plan exhibitions on mathematics, by individuals who want to learn more about mathematics, etc.\\[1ex]
